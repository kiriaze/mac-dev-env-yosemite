MDE (mac-dev-env)
===========

### Update (11.3.14)

Self executing script v.1. Please read through script.

	$ sh ./init.sh

---

### General Notes
Assumes this is on a fresh install of Yosemite. If you already have an environment setup, dont run the init.sh script, rather comb through this and cherry pick. Hopefully you're not using mamp or the like.

All references to `subl` is for opening files within the Sublime Text editor, if you haven't heard of it, no worries, this setup will install it for you and set up an alias to use it with.

Make sure your bash scripts have had `chmod +x` ran on them; e.g. `chmod +x script.sh`, making the file executable by everyone.

Mac Dev Env Setup consists of:

	homebrew
	php 5.6
	update mac unix tools
	correct paths
	git
	ruby
	mysql/mariadb
	bash/zsh
	node
	nginx
	composer
	bower
	bundler
	grunt
	gulp
	cask - pretty much all your apps
	mackup - keep your app settings in sync. wHAT?! word.
	SublimeText3 / Chrome extensions
	iTerm settings

# Run this exactly like this.

1. system pref
	* change name of computer
	* mouse/trackpad settings
	* hotspots

2. software updates
	* make sure youve updated everything.

3. xcode dev tools:
	* `$ xcode-select --install`
		* get xcode
		* install dev tools

## xquartz
	$ curl http://xquartz-dl.macosforge.org/SL/XQuartz-2.7.7.dmg -o /tmp/XQuartz.dmg
	$ open /tmp/XQuartz.dmg

## homebrew
	$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
	$ brew doctor
	$ brew update
	$ brew upgrade
	$ brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php # theres also: brew tap homebrew/php
	$ brew install php56
	$ brew install imagemagick


## Update the unix tools you already have on your mac.
1. Install GNU core utilities (those that come with OS X are outdated)
	* `$ brew install coreutils`

2. Install GNU "find", "locate", "updatedb", and "xargs", g-prefixed
	* `$ brew install findutils`

### Install Bash 4
`$ brew install bash`

### Install more recent versions of some OS X tools
`$ brew install grep`

#### You'll need to update PATH in your ~/.bash_profile to use these over their Mac counterparts:

	$ echo export PATH="$(brew --prefix coreutils)/libexec/gnubin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
	$ brew cleanup

### ZSH
#### [Why should you be using ZSH instead of bash](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	$ brew install zsh
	$ sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zprofile
	$ cat /etc/shells | grep zsh || which zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
	$ chsh -s $(which zsh)

#### Resetting your default login shell back to bash if need be
`$ chsh -s /bin/bash`

## Setup PHP CLI binary

### If you use Bash
`$ echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile && . ~/.bash_profile`

### If you use ZSH
`$ echo 'export PATH="$(brew --prefix homebrew/php/php56)/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && . ~/.zshrc`


## Setup auto start
	$ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	# note below, path version might be different
	$ cp /usr/local/Cellar/php56/5.6.32_8/homebrew.mxcl.php56.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/


### mysql
`$ brew install mysql`


### MariaDB
	$ brew unlink mysql
	$ brew info mariadb # Verify MariaDB Version in Homebrew Repo
	$ brew install mariadb # Install MariaDB

	# mysql setup auto start and start the database
	$ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist

	# Run the Database Installer
	$ unset TMPDIR
	$ cd /usr/local/Cellar/mariadb/{VERSION}
	$ mysql_install_db

	# if mysql_install_db gives you errors and such, possible conflicting and multiple "mysqld" processes could be causing the sql server instance not to launch.
	# open up activity monitor and search for mysqld, and quit those processes
	# then try to start up mariadb with the code below

	$ mysql.server start # Start MariaDB
	$ mysql_secure_installation # Secure the Installation
	$ mysql -u root -p # Connect to MariaDB

*mysql issues on 10.5.5, reference this link http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34345726/brew-install-mysql-on-mac-os-el-capitan*

### SequelPro
SequelPro is installed via apps.sh if you're running the init.sh script with a few other apps. To use with MariaDB/MySql, add new Favorite in SequelPro sidebar, and set the host to 127.0.0.1 with the username 'root' and whatever password you set above in the MariaDB setup. Test connection, and save it. Now you can easily connect to all your local databases!

### Git
	$ brew install git

	# Write settings to ~/.gitconfig
	$ git config --global user.name '{YOUR NAME}'
	$ git config --global user.email {YOUR EMAIL}

	$ git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore'
	$ echo '.DS_Store' >> ~/.gitignore

	# use keychain for storing passwords
	$ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

	# you might not see colors without this
	$ git config --global color.ui true

	# more useful settings: https://github.com/glebm/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig

	# ssh keys - probably can skip this since github app auto adds it for you which is nice
	$ ls -al ~/.ssh # Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com" # Creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label
	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" # start the ssh-agent in the background

### Install Mackup
`$ brew install mackup`

### Launch it and back up your files
`$ mackup backup`

### Local OSX Yosemite Apache Setup
In Yosemite, Apache 2.4.9 is installed. We just have to use the command line to start and stop it.

One change compared to 2.2.x worth noting is that we now need the Require all granted directive in our virtual host definitions in place of Allow from all.

```
cd /etc/apache2
subl /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
```
Within the httpd.conf:

1. To enable PHP and rewriting in Apache, remove the leading # from these lines:
    ```
    #LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
    #LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
    # Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
    ```

2. Update yur file's Apache User/Group from `_www` to your `$(whoami)` and `staff` at around line 181-182. 

3. At around line 236, you'll find the DocumentRoot and `<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents">`. Update both to: `/Users/$(whoami)/Localhost` or whichever destination you prefer.

4. Also, within `<Directory>`, update `AllowOverride None` to `AllowOverride All` so that .htaccess files will work as well as `Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews` to `Options FollowSymLinks Multiviews Indexes` so that we can view directory listings.

5. Create a $(whoami).conf within the etc/apache2/users/ directory.
    ```
    <Directory "/Users/$(whoami)/Localhost/">
    	AllowOverride All
    	Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    	Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ```

4. Give yourself permissions to the /Users/$(whoami)/Localhost/ folder using these cli commands:
	```
	sudo chgrp staff /Users/$(whoami)/Localhost
	sudo chmod g+rws /Users/$(whoami)/Localhost
	sudo chmod g+rw /Users/$(whoami)/Localhost/*
	// or otherwise specifically...but the above should handle anything added from there on out
	sudo chmod -R g+w {path}
	```

5. Remove the content ( if you want ) from /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf and add the code below before everything else
	```
	NameVirtualHost *:80
	```
Followed by an example virtual host that points to the root of your web project directory e.g. Localhost
	```
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	    DocumentRoot "/Users/kiriaze/Localhost"
	</VirtualHost>
	```

6. Restart Apache: `sudo apachectl restart`

7. Create a new file called info.php with <?php phpinfo(); ?> inside your new document root; e.g. /Users/$(whoami)/Localhost/.

8. Use your browser to navigate to `localhost/info.php` and check your PHP version, as well as anything else you might need to reference in the future.


## Notes

1. The init.sh script also installs a few other things such as: adobe-creative-cloud, MongoDB, Reddis, PostgreSQL - and you can setup your git global creds from the script as well.

2. Use [Ghosts](https://github.com/kiriaze/ghost) when creating new projects in conjuncture with this setup, and have a beer cuz you just became a fly ass mother fucker. A one liner to reference below: 
	```
	bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiriaze/ghosts/master/ghosts.sh)
	```

## Todos

Include usage of MongoDB, Reddis, PostgreSQL.

Consider dot files or a workaround for symlinking ( although osx deletes it on upgrade ) the httpd.conf file and others for local setup to prevent overwriting on OS upgrades - like el capitain..
